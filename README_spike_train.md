# 🧠 Neural Spike Train Analysis with Elephant & Neo
This project demonstrates how to analyze neural spike train data using Python scientific libraries commonly used in computational neuroscience. It covers spike train representation, slicing, visualization, synchrony metrics, and spike-distance computations using **Elephant**, **Neo**, and **Quantities**.

This notebook was originally developed as part of a computational neuroscience assignment.  
I have cleaned and documented it as a standalone example of spike train analysis workflows used in neuroengineering and electrophysiology research.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project shows how to:
- Represent spike timing data using `neo.SpikeTrain`
- Visualize neural activity using raster plots
- Compute **interspike intervals (ISI)**
- Slice spike trains by time windows
- Calculate **spike synchrony** between neuron pairs
- Compute **spike distance metrics**
- Merge spike trains for population-level analysis

These techniques are widely used in:
- HD-MEA data analysis
- cortical organoid electrophysiology
- computational neuroscience
- neuro-signal processing
- neuromorphic modeling
